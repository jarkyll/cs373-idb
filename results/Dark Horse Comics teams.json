        "description": "<h2>Biology</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Predators - or, in their tongue, Yautja - are large bipedal, humanoid <a href=\"/aliens/4015-46567\" data-ref-id=\"4015-46567\">aliens</a>. They stand anywhere from 6-8 feet in height and weigh hundreds of pounds. Their body is very muscular; due to their lifestyle-and, presumably, diet-very little of their body weight consists of fat. The colour of their skin varies from individual to individual-sometimes it is a pasty yellow, a light or dark green, or gray.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">They almost always wear masks when they go on hunting excursions, and as a result their faces are rarely seen. They are very distinct, and nothing like a humans. They have small, green or yellow eyes and large broad foreheads. Their mouth is covered by four mandibles and behind those are another mouth-a sort of \"mutated crab\" appearance. On the back of their head are long tubes that resemble dreadlocks.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Physically, Yautja are faster, stronger, and more durable than any human-they have shown the speed to evade bullet fire, the durability to take bullets and explosions, and the strength to punch through concrete. Unlike ours, their blood is a neon green-easily seen by it's distinct colour. It is uncertain but believed that all of their sense are superior to humans as well-however, they can also use the systems built into their masks to have heightened vision in many different ways, and increase their hearing capabilities. Yautja also have great physical strength, shown when most Yautja hunters are able to almost effortlessly tear out spines from human corpses.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">They need to breath air to survive, and prefer a hot, humid environment (although they can still survive in cold conditions easily, as a trio of young Yautja walked the ice of deep <a href=\"/antarctica/4020-55940\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55940\">Antarctica</a> with no support). Predators are able to breath Terran atmosphere, although the Jungle Hunter in the 1987 movie was shown to wear a breathing device after its Bio-Mask was taken off.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It is possible that they live longer than humans can possibly hope for, possibly into the hundreds of years. However, it is also possible that their \"longevity\" is relative to humans due to interstellar travel.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A sub-species of Yautja are called the Super-Predators, who are typically taller, paler, and bulkier than mainstream Yautja. </p><h2>Society</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It is believed, but not confirmed that Yautja males stay with their mothers for a long period of time until they mature. Their first rite of passage is the binding of the \"dreadlocks\" to their heads-this process is said to be extremely painful and lasts for upwards of a month. If the young Yautja moves or shows any sign of the pain, the ritual is to be attempted again and again until successful.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The entire civilization of the Yautja revolves around the Hunt. While most species would pick a satisfactory area and stay with it, the Yautja move from planet to planet and area to area, based off of the hunting conditions. The most important ritual that a Yautja will have to pass is the first Hunt-alone, or in a small group, they leave the rest of their clan to hunt one of the most prized prey, \"The Serpents\", or as humans would call them, \" <a href=\"/aliens/4060-20659\" data-ref-id=\"4060-20659\">Xenomorphs</a>\" or \"Aliens\". If successful, the Yautja will receive his more advanced weapons (Plasmacaster, energy bolts, etc.), and be invited onto more hunts. The Yautja bears a scar on it's forehead, generated by the acidic blood of the Xenomorphs, proving that he killed a Xenomorph.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">If a Yautja were to flee and return without evidence or proof, he would commit suicide with a sacrificial dagger, which is the ultimate disgrace. After successful completion of the ritual, the Yautja are considered of the Young Blood class. The mark on their forehead is not only a sign of respect, but one to mark which clan they belong to-every mark is different and exclusive to one clan. Young Bloods are viewed as ambitious and reckless. They bear the trophy of their first kill - the skull of the Xenomorph - as a symbol of power. After holding the title for a length of time, the Yautja are simply known as Blooded Hunters.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While initially they may appear to be ruthless, brutal, and savage, the Yautja and their hunts are really governed by a strict code of ethics, much like the <a href=\"/samurai/4015-55836\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55836\">Samurai</a>. It promotes honor, skill, and loyalty to the Clan. Those that follow this codes will not kill the female or weak of the prey species, as it is dishonorable to kill those that cannot defend themselves (though not always the case, as some females are well worthy of hunting). The Yautja that strictly follow and believe in the code are of the Warrior class. The Warrior Yautja travel across the universe alone, looking for worthy hunts.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When a Yautja demonstrates great honor, skill, and determination, they are viewed with respect. If it is great enough, they may be promoted to the Elder class. The Elders of the Yautja are of the highest respect and of most honor. They are the oldest, the wisest, the most skilled. They are the greatest Predators that have ever lived. Elders often have spared other species that have demonstrated such honor, usually from either defeating or fighting in line with a fellow Yautja. The Elders view these individuals as equals, regardless of species or gender.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The lowest of the ranks in the Yautja society are that of the Bad Blood. They are the disgraced Yautja, those that have disgraced the Hunt, broken the codes and performed other foul deeds. There are two classes to counteract the Bad Blood - the Honoured class, those who are skilled in all ways but not quite Elders, and the Arbitrators, the Yautja law enforcement. They are permitted to eliminate any Bad Blood on sight. Bad Bloods travel alone, running constantly. Some may be misunderstood, but others are evil and kill anything they see-perhaps even other Yautja.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">An exception to this law are the Super-Predators, who exhibit little regard of Yautja hunting traditions and have been in conflict with mainstream Yautja society for an unknown period of time. The Super-Predators employ the use of traps and train Xenomorphs as bloodhounds, all of which are forbidden by Yautja tradition. </p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">In the female society, not much is for certain. It is known, however, that they are larger than the males, and possibly stronger. They stay in the dwelling while the males hunt, and care for the young Yautja - they are extremely protective of their young.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Yautja hunters also have great respect for humans who are demonstrate capabilities enough to defeat one of their own or fight alongside them. Humans who have killed a Yautja or Xenomorph are honored with a trophy, usually an antique weapon.</p><h3 style=\"margin-right:0px;margin-left:0px;\">Yautja Honor Code</h3><p>The Yautja have a codified law which is followed religiously by all members of their species, specifically hunters and warriors. They can be summmarized in these points:</p><ol><li>Hunting Worthy Game; a Yautja hunter must ensure that their prey pose sufficient threat to them and show unwillingness to be hunter. Typically, unworthy game include children, the elderly, pregnant females, and the sickly.</li><li>Honorable Death; hunters are expected to commit suicide when faced with failure in combat. Those who do not are viewed as cowards and outlaws, and Arbitrators are tasked with killing them.</li><li>Hunt Weak Prey For Food; formidable prey cannot be eaten so as to purify their species' genetics.</li><li>Do Not Claim Others' Trophies; it is a great offense to take other hunters' Trophies.</li><li>Do Not Kill Wounded Game; game whose injuries are inflicted by other hunters cannot be killed by someone else whenever possible. If the game is still able to defend itself, the Trophy shall be a Joint Trophy.</li><li>Never Interfere With Other Hunts; Yautja hunters must never enter the hunting grounds of another hunter without their permission.</li></ol><h2>Communication and Language</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Yautja language is complex-they have both a full alphabet as well as slang. Their verbal language consists of chirps, roars, and barks. Most well known of their verbal ways is their chilling, nerve-racking laughter.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">They have a sign language that they use to silently communicate while on the hunt. Among these signs are movements of their mandibles to show emotions. The three most common signs go as followed-lower mandibles spread means aggression, mandibles flared means anger, and having mandibles flared as well as arched is pure rage.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Yautja hunters who have spent some time on Earth also possess at least some understanding of human communication. In the movie Predator 2 (1990), a hunter was able to imitate English and a leader of a Yautja clan is able to communicate in English.</p><h2>Civilization and Methods</h2><h3>Homeworld</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It has not been discovered whether or not the Yautja have a specific home world. It is likely that they originated from a specific planet, but as with their nomadic ways it is almost impossible to directly pinpoint the first planet. As it is, the Yautja inhabit many different planets for different Clans. For a home world to support a species such as the Yautja, it must have a few requirements, and thus we can describe what must the origin home world had been like.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Yautja breath air-thus, the planet must have been much like our own, able to support life easily. Due to the hot preferences of the Yautja, it is likely that the planet was hot and humid, with a large amount of plants giving out the natural gases necessary for them to survive. In the movie Alien Vs. Predator-Requiem, the lead Yautja, <a href=\"/wolf/4005-50380\" data-ref-id=\"4005-50380\">Wolf</a>, leaves his lair on a jungle planet. This supports that the Yautja most likely colonize or originated from a hot, humid, forested environment. It's also likely that it had multitudes of alien life on the planet-perhaps enforcing the Hunt mentality onto the Yautja.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Since the vision of the Yautja seem to be in infra-red mode, it is possible that the home world's sun, or light source, was very far away-making the planet dark and the Yautja's vision necessary to survive.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">As for the Yautja's superhuman durability, strength, and speed, it's possible that the planet from which they originated from had a much higher gravity than ours, making the Yautja need to evolve in order to survive. It's also possible that, with the trees and other dangerous life forms, the Yautja evolved in order to become acrobatic as the easily move in the jungle environment.</p><h3>Government</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It is not known how-other than the Hunt mentality-the Yautja civilization controls itself and maintains order. It's possible that, with the Elders representing their individual clans, there is a Senate or group of Yautja who form the decision makers of the species.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It is also possible that instead, a war was fought, with the dominant Clan forming a total dictatorship over the others. It would face much opposition if true.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The final theory is that, since female Yautja are in greater number and possibly stronger than the males, they dominate the civilization in all other aspects of life besides the Hunt. Then, it is easy to assume that a single leader controls the species-a Yautja Queen.</p><h2>Weapons</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Yautja''s technology is superior to humans and much more advanced. It is unknown whether or not the Yautja created this technology.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">While on a Hunt, a Yautja will carry a large pack of equipment in it's belt, backpack, or different storage compartments. Different Yautja personalize their equipment in different ways, but generally this is the equipment present on a Hunt.</p><h3>Mask</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A standard for every respected Yautja hunter-the mask is an invaluable tool while on a Hunt. Contained within it's operating systems are different types of vision (including Infra-red, motion sensing, and night-vision, among others), sound improvements, and breathing aids. It also includes a sort of word-copy device, which allows the Yautja to communicate with alien life by mimicking the sounds it heard earlier. Also in the masks systems is a tracking device for any shoulder-mounted weapon.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Every mask is created by the Yautja that wears it, and thus, no two are alike.</p><h3>Body Wire Mail</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">This is the basic clothing of a Yautja while hunting. It provides electricity-generated heat to keep the hunter warm in cold climates, and also serves as a component to their cloaking device. It is worn under the armour of a Yautja, and covers the entire body with a padding or mesh.</p><h3>Armour</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The armour that a Yautja wears while hunting is a single plate comprised of unknown metal-like everything created by the Yautja. It is light and maneuverable, but can still take heavy blows. Some armour is even capable of resisting the acidic qualities of Xenomorph blood.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There is another type of armour used only for ceremonies, but that is more for show than actual defense.</p><h3>Cloak</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The cloak is a invaluable piece of equipment to a Yautja while on the hunt. It bends the lightwaves around the hunter, and makes them almost totally invisible to the naked eye. However, it isn't foolproof-a shimmer can be seen while the Yautja is moving, much like a heatwave. The cloaking seems to disrupt or malfunction while surrounded by water, so it is likely that it is unused in a fog or raining environment.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Mounted weapons are cloaked by the effect, but once they are revealed and combat ready (such as a extend-able spear) they become fully visible.</p><h3>Wrist Blades</h3><figure style=\"width: 320px\" data-align=\"left\" data-size=\"small\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1276946\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18154/1276946-lame_de_poignet_wrist_blade.jpg\" data-ratio=\"0.75336322869955\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.3%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/1/18154/1276946-lame_de_poignet_wrist_blade.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1276946\"><img src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18154/1276946-lame_de_poignet_wrist_blade.jpg\" alt=\"The Yautja Wrist Blades\"></a><figcaption>The Yautja Wrist Blades</figcaption></figure><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Wrist Blades are arguably the most used weapon by a Yautja. They are range from twelve to eighteen inches long, are almost totally indestructible, and are capable of cutting straight through bone. They are either of straight, pointed design or more stylistic with ridges and curves for maximum cutting power.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">However, they have shown significant vulnerabilities to Xenomorph blood.</p><h3>Plasma Caster</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The <a href=\"/plasma-caster/4055-56382\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56382\">Plasma Caster</a>, or Shoulder Cannon, is the most deadly weapon that a Yautja will carry on a normal hunt. It is controlled by the targeting system inside the mask, and fires rapid, long range plasma pulses capable of killing a Xenomorph in one shot.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It can be fired either by the hand or by a trigger inside the helmet via mandible.</p><h3>Med Kit</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It may not be capable of killing, but it is just as useful as any weapon. The Med Kit is a small kit that a Yautja carries with them in case of medical emergencies. It contains supplies to stop bleeding from gunshot wounds as well as heal the body internally. However, it seems more painful to use than to deal with the wound-most Predators roar in fury and pain when they apply the medicine.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It also includes emergency breathers, surgical blades, and a medicine crystallizer, among other things.</p><h3>Spear Gun</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Spear Gun is a weapon that can fire long range, spear-like projectiles form a far distance-the Yautja equivalent to a sniper rifle. The bolts can either kill instantly or impale a target against a wall or obstacle.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are two modules of the Spear Gun-one is built in to the Yautja's wrist compartment, and the other is a larger weapon that must be carried around individually.</p><h3>Naginata</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Naginata is a bladed weapon of similar design as a partisan. It can be either one-sided or dualed, and the Yautja in question wields it like a bow-staff. It is very ceremonial and a respected weapon. It is made of nigh-unbreakable alloy and can be used for either cutting or stabbing strikes.</p><h3>Dagger</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Dagger used by the Yautja is for skinning their first kill-a Xenomorph, and for their first rite in order to put a scar upon their forehead signifying the kill. It is either constructed from the bones or is coated with the skin of the Xenomorph, making it immune to the acidic qualities within their blood.</p><h3>Net Launcher</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Net Launcher is a small weapon, either carried or inside of the wrist compartment, that, when fired, launches out a net made of unknown steel. Should it wrap around a target, it will gradually close tighter and tighter until the target is killed. The pressure can be released by the Yautja should he feel the need.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It has been shown to be vulnerable to the acid blood of Xenomorphs, as the bleeding alien burned through the steel and killed it's Yautja attacker.</p><h3>Combi-Stick</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The <a href=\"/combi-staff/4055-56384\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56384\">Combi-Stick</a> is a spear that first appears very small, but once a button is pressed on the outside it extends in both ways. It is very sharp on both ends, like a spear, and is wielded like a bow-staff. It can be thrown to puncture targets from afar, and when it is swung electricity surrounds both tips to maximize cutting power.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are many different designs of the Combi-Stick, and some have been shown to be even triple pronged to one side.</p><h3>Smart Disc</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The <a href=\"/smart-disc/4055-56250\" data-ref-id=\"4055-56250\">Smart Disc</a> is one of the most useful weapons in a Yautja's inventory. It is a round, slim disc with razor edges. When thrown, a heat field is generated around it, increasing the already impressive cutting power of the weapon. Internal gyros ensure that it returns to it's thrower, but should it become stuck in a solid object a press of a button will have it come flying back.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It was once shown to easily cut straight through several frozen cow carcasses and then straight through a man who was fleeing the Yautja hunter.</p><h3>Shuriken</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Shuriken is much like the Smart Disc, but of more stylistic design and slightly more primitive. When hidden, the Shuriken is a small, slim, round disc, but at the push of a button it extends and several long razor edges protrude outwards and it becomes a multi-edges throwing star. Like the Smart Disc, it has internal devices to always ensure that the weapon returns to the wielder once thrown.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It can be used for either close combat or long range attacks, and has been shown as able to cut straight through a fully grown Xenomorph.</p><h3>Burner</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The Burner is the most devastating weapon a Yautja can carry with himself. Due to their destructive power, they are not normally carried on simple hunts as they are viewed as dishonorable. The Burner is a weapon that fires out either large explosives fireballs or huge streams of flame. They are used only for raids on Xenomorph colonies to seize a new queen. It was once recorded showing a Burner take the head off of a fully-grown Queen with one shot.</p><h3>Self-Destruct Device</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The wrist compartment can be used for many things-changing vision modes, language mimics, but the most dangerous is the self-destruct mechanism, a Predator's most powerful weapon. Should a Yautja warrior be defeated, this is his last act to ensure honor. The countdown can be set, but once it reaches zero a semi-nuclear explosion erupts in a 360 degree radius and destroy anything in the vicinity. The Device can be detached if needed.</p><h2>Space Travel</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">There are different forms and classes of Yautja space ships, and are used in different situations. However, many are used for the purpose of only one thing-the Hunt.</p><h3>Individual Shuttle</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">If necessary to initiate a Hunt, a small, one Yautja large shuttle will be launched from a larger ship with a Yautja still inside. It's course cannot be altered, and thrusters on the back of the small shuttle are used to punch through the atmosphere of the target planet. Once through the atmosphere, reverse thrusters are used to slow the descent of the shuttle. They impact in a upright position and then open for the Yautja to exit. They cannot be used to leave a planet-it is a one-way trip.</p><h3>One-Hunter Shuttle</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A ship large enough for one Yautja to live in and store his equipment and trophies. It contains basic navigation systems and is used for short interplanetary travel. It can be landed onto a planet and cloaked, or bury itself underground and await for it's owner to return.</p><h3>Clan Ships</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">These large ships can transport entire Clans. They are of unique design for each individual Clan and are capable of long range travel. They are controlled by the most respected hunters of each Clan and provide comfortable living quarters for each Yautja on board.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">It is also capable of trapping a <a href=\"/alien-queen/4005-52594\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52594\">Xenomorph Queen</a> and has a egg processor, so as to prepare the ritual for new Yautja warriors.</p><h3>Mothership</h3><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">A class rumoured to exist, it is a mobile space base capable of supporting hundreds of Yautja within it's decks as well as housing numerous craft for hunting expeditions. It almost never would itself go out on a Hunt, leaving that to smaller Clan crafts. Here, Yautja can seek a mate, battle for respect and honor, or trade new equipment.</p><h2>Comics</h2><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">The first comics in the Predator series are focused around Detective Mike Shaefer who is the brother of Dutch (Arnold's character) He is determined to find his brother since Dutch has disappeared after the events in the first movie. Since the launch of the series their have been numerous crossover involving famous or well known characters, Including <a href=\"/batman/4005-1699\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1699\">Batman</a> vs Predator, <a href=\"/magnus/4005-12457\" data-ref-id=\"4005-12457\">Magnus Robot Fighter</a> vs Predator, <a href=\"/judge-dredd/4005-30061\" data-ref-id=\"4005-30061\">Judge Dredd</a> vs Predator, <a href=\"/superman/4005-1807\" data-ref-id=\"4005-1807\">Superman</a> vs Predator, and the most well known crossover Aliens vs Predator, just to name a few.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During the Aliens Versus Predator series, their first meeting published on a comic takes place on a recently colonized planet called Ryushi. The settlers, unknown of the planet's historical use to the Predator as a hunting ground, raise cattle for export to nearby planets. Meanwhile, a Predator ship approaches the planet for initiation rites for new potential hunters. They prepare their prey to let loose on the planet, which are eggs of a Xenomorph Queen.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">When the eggs are released by the Predator hunters, they quickly infect the planet. When the Predator hunting party sets foot on the planet, they unsuspectingly come into contact with human settlers in which a battle is commenced and the Predator leader, Broken Tusk is captured and wounded. The hunters soon decide that the humans are their newest prey and decide to hunt them.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">Elsewhere, the infected colony known as Rhynth has loaded their shipment of cattle which among the infected livestock is one with a Queen growing inside that escaped the Predator ship and an Alien hive starts to grow. Soon Aliens start to attack the predators and humans who are clutched in a battle. Broken Tooth soon recovers due to the aid of a human doctor and he decides to side with the humans to destroy the Aliens.</p><p data-right-indent=\"0\" data-left-indent=\"0\">During the new alliance and fight, Broken Tooth is nearly killed and with the last of his strength left, he marks a human, Machiko Noguchi the leader of the colony with the sign of Broken Tooth's clan. At the end of this brutal story, <a href=\"/machiko-noguchi/4005-69051\" data-ref-id=\"4005-69051\">Machiko</a> is visited by a rival clan of Broken Tooth and their leader accepts her as a member of the hunt.</p>",

        "description": "<h2>Xenomorph Life Cycle</h2><p>There are several different phases to a Xenomorph's life-cycle, and what kind of adult Xenomorph will come into existence depends entirely on the being that it hatches from.</p><h3><b>Egg</b></h3><p>Eggs are lain by an <a href=\"/alien-queen/4005-52594\" data-ref-id=\"4005-52594\">Alien Queen</a>, and exiting her body through an overgrown egg sack. The egg is a leathery sack approximately 2.5 feet tall. They are the very simple first step in the Xenomorph life cycle.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/119711/2834057-183884_32309_alien.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2834057\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.39\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:139.0%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/119711/2834057-183884_32309_alien.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2834057\"><img src=\"http://static1.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/119711/2834057-183884_32309_alien.jpg\" alt=\"2834057-183884_32309_alien.jpg\"></a></figure><h3>Facehugger</h3><p>The <a href=\"/face-hugger/4055-49618\" data-ref-id=\"4055-49618\">Facehugger</a> is what lays inside the egg. After a certain amount of time or if a host were to come too close to an egg, the Facehugger inside senses it through pheromones, and the egg opens up like a blossoming flower with the Facehugger launching itself out and planting itself onto the host's face.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/119711/2834069-2657570_alien_the_illustrated_story.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2834069\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.59473684210526\" data-width=\"320\" data-embed-type=\"image\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.5%\" href=\"http://static.comicvine.com/uploads/original/11/119711/2834069-2657570_alien_the_illustrated_story.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2834069\"><img src=\"http://static2.comicvine.com/uploads/scale_small/11/119711/2834069-2657570_alien_the_illustrated_story.jpg\" alt=\"2834069-2657570_alien_the_illustrated_story.jpg\"></a></figure><p>Its long tail will wrap around the host's neck, and it will grip the head with its long eight legs - the Facehugger resembles a flat spider, in a sense. It has acidic blood and will bleed the acid on its victim if cut, and if attempts are made for it to be pried off, its tail tightens around the host's neck and a chemical will cause them to go into a cardiac arrest. The Facehugger also makes its host unconscious with oxygen deprivation. Once the Alien embryo is planted into the host's body, the Facehugger will detach, and die shortly afterwords. The host will wake up with no recollection to the event.</p><h3><strong>Chestburster</strong></h3><p>As time passes, the egg that was planted inside of the host will begin to stir. Then, it will begin to claw its way out of the host's chest, through the center of his ribcage. This obviously causes extreme pain, and as soon as the Chestburster breaks through, the host dies. It will then flee at top speeds to grow into its adult form and become even more dangerous. Its appearance changes in its variations, but it is small, with an elongated cranium, pale or dark skin, and a long tail - almost like a snake. Basically, Chestbursters are infant versions of Xenomorphs.</p><h3><strong>Adult</strong></h3><p>There are many different kinds of Adult Xenomorphs - however, they share the same general appearance. After the Chestburster has fled, it will wait and mature, shedding its old skin to reveal the darker kind, and its head will expand backwards into a crescent shape. It will grow arms and legs, its tail will lengthen and become much stronger (even to the point of being able to impale fully grown humans), and its blood will be much more acidic. Xenomorphs have many distinguishing features, namely:</p><ul><li>They do not show up on infra-red scanners, as they take on the temperature of their environment (this contributes to their adaptability).</li><li>Inside of their mouth is a second \"mouth\" - in appearance - however, this is its tongue, which has shown the strength to be able to punch through skulls, steel, and even the highly durable metal of the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/predators/4060-18392\" data-ref-id=\"4060-18392\">Predator</a> species.</li><li>They (apparently) do not have visible eyes, but can see pheromones and inverted light which would explains how they can detect cloaked Predators and see in the dark.</li></ul><p>Xenomorphs are the stuff of nightmares - they are vicious, cannot be reasoned with, and will never, ever give up. They operate entirely on the instinct to survive and propagate their race, but are surprisingly intelligent, able to remember through genetic memory their host's life and past. They communicate with a Queen and each other through changing pheromones and/or sub-supersonic sounds.</p><h2><b>Variations</b></h2><p>There are several variations of adult Xenomorphs, as they take on the characteristics of the host from which they hatch in order to better adapt to their environment. Countless varieties have been proposed throughout the various forms of media in which Xenomorphs have been depicted. Video games have added a considerable amount of these in order to create unique enemies of differing strengths and capabilities for players to fight. These variations are typically the result of Xenomorphs hatching from different kinds of hosts, but they also sometimes result from genetic tampering with the Xenomorphs by organizations seeking to exploit the race's unique abilities.</p><p>There are a select few that are most often depicted however, namely:</p><ul><li>The most well-known are the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/alien-warrior/4005-61046\" data-ref-id=\"4005-61046\">\"Warrior\" brood</a>. These are the ones that appeared in both the <em><a href=\"/alien/4025-63\" data-ref-id=\"4025-63\">Alien</a></em> and <em><a href=\"/aliens/4025-80\" data-ref-id=\"4025-80\">Aliens</a></em> films - they have the long crescent head, dark skin, sharp claws, and deadly tongues; and they are the result of Xenomorphs hatching from humans, or at least beings with characteristics similar to humans..</li><li>The next type was the <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/alien-runner/4005-91389\" data-ref-id=\"4005-91389\">\"Runner\"</a> - this is the Xenomorph that appeared primarily in <em><a href=\"/alien-3/4025-549\" data-ref-id=\"4025-549\">Alien 3</a></em>. This brood is especially fast and agile, and is also known as the Dog Alien for having hatched from a dog. It appears to only hatch from quadrupedal hosts.</li><li>An especially unique brood appears in <em><a href=\"/alien-resurrection/4025-397\" data-ref-id=\"4025-397\">Alien Resurrection</a></em> - an Alien that is half human/half-Xenomorph. It looked more human than other Xenomorphs, as it had no tail, normally walked on two legs, and its skin wasn't black. It looked somewhat like a human newborn baby. It was created through the unintentional gene-splicing that occurred when <a href=\"/ellen-ripley/4005-54485\" data-ref-id=\"4005-54485\">Ellen Ripley</a> was cloned in order to retrieve the adolescent Alien Queen that had been inside her when she died. The Alien Queen wound up getting Ripley's reproductive genes, receiving a degree of human DNA, with some Xenomorph genes used to fill in the gaps. This was a genetic aberration however, and was undoubtedly the only one of its kind to ever come into existence.</li></ul><h3><a href=\"/predalien/4005-49598\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49598\">Predalien</a></h3><p>There are two types of <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/predalien/4005-49598\" data-ref-id=\"4005-49598\">Predaliens</a>. One looks like an Alien with a spike-covered turtle shell. Not much is known of of this type except that it's resistant to low-caliber ammunition.</p><p>The other type was created when a Facehugger latched onto a <a href=\"//www.comicvine.com/predator/4005-51361\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51361\">Predator</a>'s face, causing the offspring to be a hybrid between Alien and Predator. The Predalien looks much the same as an ordinary Alien, except it has Predator mandibles on its mouth and has the enlarged forehead of a Predator with black dreadlocks coming out. The Queen breed of Predaliens also doesn't require a Facehugger to harvest new Aliens, as it's capable of projecting Xenomorph embryos directly into hosts - in one case, up to twenty embryos were planted by a Predalien Queen into a pregnant human female host. Predaliens also appear to be stronger than both standard Xenomorphs and Predators, as one was shown to be capable of pinning a Predator up against a wall with only one hand.</p><h3>Alien Queen</h3><p>The Queen is the center of all Xenomorphs in the colony - it is what births them, and it is the strongest, largest, and fastest of them all. When it's mounted in a structure constructed by either her or her servants, it is stuck in place, and births the eggs from which the Facehuggers launch. However, it can detach itself in a painful manner from its confines , and stand fully tall if necessary. Its appearance is like that of an adult Xenomorph, except that it has a large and wide head crest, it has 4-6 arms - with two extremely small while two or four others are long and powerful - as with its legs, and it is the size of over three humans standing on top of one another.</p><p>The Queen's only job is to propagate the Xenomorph race by laying as many eggs as possible. The Queen comes with a huge \"sack\" in which Xenomorph eggs are made and stored until they are laid. When the queen is in danger, angered, or needs to move her hive, she will separate from the egg-producing sack.</p><p>All other Xenomorphs serve the Queen by protecting her, building her hive, and bringing her hosts for her eggs to use to make more Xenomorphs. When separated from a Queen however, Xenomorphs tend to become entirely feral and will do nothing but slaughter anything that is not their own species. A lone Xenomorph can therefore be at times even more dangerous than a group of them.</p><h2>Connection To Predators</h2><p>Xenomorphs and the <a href=\"/predator/4005-51361\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51361\">Yautja (Predators)</a> have a long history with one another. The Yautja hunt Xenomorphs for sport, as well as for rights of passage. They will, when in need of a new Queen, raid a Xenomorph colony and steal one. They will then forcibly use that Queen to make eggs, and then they will plant the eggs on a planet. Inevitably, a Xenomorph outbreak will occur, in which the Yautja will send their rookie Hunters to the planet to claim their first kills. After the Yautja return from their first hunt, another group of experienced hunters will come and exterminate all trace of the Xenomorphs, returning the planet to its natural balance.</p><p>However, occasionally a few Xenomorphs escape the slaughter. If that were to occur, the planet can become overrun and is lost to the creatures.</p><h2>Other Media</h2><h3>Novels</h3><p><b>Aliens: Cauldron</b> - <i>Space: the most hostile environment in the universe.

The film follows the crew of a space cargo-ship, the Nostromo, who land on a hostile planet in response to a faint SOS only to discover an abandoned ship with a ravenous alien on board. Alien inspired three movie sequels, and now Aliens: Original Sin expands further on this classic story, bringing back characters like Ripley 8, the clone of Lt. Ellen Ripley, and android Call. It also sorts out unanswered questions from the movies and raises entirely new ones. Was it just coincidence that the Nostromo happened to pass by the desolate planet? Why was the alien on the crashed ship in the first place? The answers, along with intense action, chilling horror, and even deeper questions await in suspense virtuoso Michael Jan Friedman's Aliens: Original Sin.</i></p><ul><li>Written By: Michael Jan Friedman</li><li>Publication Date: October 26, 2005</li></ul><p><b>Aliens: Steel Egg</b> - <i>Someone on Earth knew about the aliens.

        "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense was formed towards the end of 1944 by <a href=\"/trevor-bruttenholm/4005-5478\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5478\">Professor Trevor Bruttenholm</a>. The need came about after Nazi Germany had begun utilizing occult individuals and weapons against their enemies. Bruttenholm would continue to serve as the director of B.P.R.D. until the late 1950s. Bruttenholm decided to step down from his position in order to focus on field work.</p><p>The next and current director is <a href=\"/tom-manning/4005-42719\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42719\">Dr. Thomas Manning</a>. He started adding agents with special abilities first of which was <a href=\"/elizabeth-sherman/4005-5475\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5475\">Liz Sherman</a>, who became the ward of the Bureau in 1974. The next agent was <a href=\"/abe-sapien/4005-25795\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25795\">Abe Sapien</a>, who was found in the basement of St. Trinidad Hospital.</p><p>The BPRD is a well known to many governments and agencies around the world and has maintained a good relationship with most of them, excluding <a href=\"/peoples-republic-of-china/4020-55795\" data-ref-id=\"4020-55795\">China</a> and <a href=\"/cia/4060-55745\" data-ref-id=\"4060-55745\">CIA</a>.</p><h2>Agents</h2><p>BPRD has a good mix of human and special powered individual agents. Most notably <a href=\"/hellboy/4005-5466\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5466\">Hellboy</a>, who has resigned, <a href=\"/elizabeth-sherman/4005-5475\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5475\">Liz Sherman</a> and <a href=\"/abe-sapien/4005-25795\" data-ref-id=\"4005-25795\">Abe Sapien</a>, who still remain with the organization. For more detailed accounts, check the Members section of this page.</p><h2>Appearances in other media</h2><h3>Films</h3><p>BPRD has appeared in all four Hellboy movies. Its history however has changed a bit.</p><ul><li>BPRD is a government organization, which was created by Roosevelt. It was created to counter Hitler's growing power in the occult. It also has strong connections to the FBI.</li><li>Since Hellboy II, the public is aware of BPRD's existence.</li><li>There are other branches in other countries, but only the German Branch has been confirmed.</li><li>BPRD might own or be connected to Area 51.</li></ul>",

The name is a clear reference to the group of ghost-hunting teenagers from Scooby-Doo. The line-up of the group varied from year to year but the core remained intact throughout the program's run, which was Buffy herself and her best friends, Xander and Willow. Most argue Giles, Buffy's watcher to be the fourth member, and he is widely accepted as being so, despite his absence from the majority of season six. <br />\u00a0<br /><br /></p>",

        "description": "<h2>Origin</h2><p>The <a href=\"/jedi/4015-52199\" data-ref-id=\"4015-52199\">Jedi</a> are an organization of the <a href=\"/old-republic/4060-51880\" data-ref-id=\"4060-51880\">Galactic Republic</a> that enforces laws and peacekeeping the Galactic Republic. They fight for peace, justice, and democracy. The Jedi\u2019s main enemy are the <a href=\"/the-sith/4060-44460\" data-ref-id=\"4060-44460\">Sith</a>, the Sith are the exact opposite of the Jedi. The Sith are a force of evil that are looking to oppress and dominate the universe. Only Jedi and some Sith (usually those that are former Jedi) have the ability to use <a href=\"/the-force/4015-50253\" data-ref-id=\"4015-50253\">the Force</a>.</p><p>The Force is an energy force generated from all living organism and wield it into different abilities. Jedi draw their Force from organisms inside their own bodies called \u201cmidi-chlorians.\u201d The Jedi represent the good side of \u201cThe Force\u201d whereas the Sith represents the dark side of \u201cThe Force.\u201d</p><h2>Creation</h2><p>As a major part of the Star Wars franchise all major credit for creation of the 'Jedi Order' goes to <a href=\"/george-lucas/4040-56180\" data-ref-id=\"4040-56180\">George Lucas</a>.</p><h2>Team Evolution</h2><h4>The Jedi Code</h4><p>The Jedi have a philosophical code that all Jedi members must memorize. It is basically an instruction enforces discipline to the Jedi. Throughout the history of the Jedi, there have been many different versions of the Jedi Code. The earliest known Jedi Code is recited as:</p><p><em>There is no emotion; there is peace</em>. <em>There is no ignorance; there is knowledge.</em> <em>There is no passion; there is serenity.</em> <em>There is no chaos; there is harmony.</em> <strong>(Added in the video game \"Star Wars: KotOR\")</strong> <em>There is no death; there is the Force.</em></p><p>After the fall of the Empire and the reconstruction of the new Jedi Order, Luke Skywalker establishes a new code for the Jedi. It has the same philosophies as the previous codes but was rewritten for better understanding from new generations of Jedi:</p><p><em>Jedi are the guardians of peace in the galaxy.</em>. <em>Jedi use their powers to defend and protect, never to attack others.</em> <em>Jedi respect all life, in any form.</em> <em>Jedi serve others rather than ruling over them, for the good of the galaxy.</em> <em>Jedi seek to improve themselves through knowledge and training.</em> The crystal is the heart of the blade.The heart is the crystal of the Jedi.The Jedi is the crystal of the Force.The Force is the blade of the heart.All are intertwined:The crystal, The blade, The Jedi.You are one.</p><h3>Jedi Ranking</h3><h4>Youngling</h4><p>This term is usually used for all young children. However, for the Jedi it is the lowest ranking in the Jedi ranks. These are usually children that have the ability to use the force. When they are discovered, the younglings would leave their home and family forever for training. They then train in classes with other younglings and are taught by a Jedi Master. By the age of 13, a youngling will graduate from the academy and must be selected by a Jedi Knight to be their Padawan. If they are not chosen, the youngling will be placed in another role within the Jedi services.</p><h4>Padawan</h4><p>After a youngling graduates from the academy and is chosen by a Jedi Knight, they become a Padawan and officially goes under training to become a Jedi Knight themselves. A tradition for human Padawans is they must then grow a long strand of hair then have it braided, after they pass the final test it is cut off as a sign that they have become a Jedi Knight. The Padawan would accompany the Jedi Knight on missions and gain lessons during from the Jedi Knight. They will eventually become full-fledged Jedi Knights after they complete \u201cthe trials.\u201d The \u201ctrials\u201d test the padawan\u2019s physical and mental toughness, as well as their knowledge and dedication to the Jedi. Another way for a Padawan to be promoted is by performing a heroic act.</p><h4>Jedi Knight</h4><p>A Jedi Knight is the title given to those who have been promoted from Padawan status. It is the most common rank amongst the Jedi. They are experienced Jedi that no longer need lesson, but in fact is the status to gain a Padawan and teach him the good side of the Force. Jedi Knights are very experienced with the Force and skills of the lightsaber. In order to be promoted to the next rank, Jedi Master, a Jedi Knight must successfully train a Padawan to become a Jedi Knight. An alternative way to gain the Master status is if a Jedi Knight has become more powerful and gained more knowledge of the Force, the Jedi Council can nominate and vote if the Jedi Knight is allowed to take a new difficult trail. Also another alternative is to perform a heroic act as a Jedi Knight.</p><h4>Jedi Master</h4><p>Jedi Masters is the rankings of powerful Jedi who have completed any of the tasks as a Jedi Knight. Jedi Masters are eligible to become one of the Jedi Council Members, however it is not required for Jedi Masters to become a part of the Jedi Council.</p><h4>Jedi Council Member</h4><p><a href=\"/the-jedi-high-council/4060-45051\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45051\">The Jedi High Council</a> is made up of 12 Jedi Masters, and occasionally a Jedi Knight can be a part of the council to give \u201ca different perspective.\u201d Once a Jedi Council seat becomes available, the other Council members begin looking for a new candidate and nominate within the Council. The council is considered the gathering \u201cof great minds.\u201d The Council is perceived to be a conclave of equals, however when there is a council member that has been in that seat for a long time, they are usually wise ones that are considered \u201csenior members\u201d and their opinion are always taken into consideration. Examples of \u201csenior members\u201d would be Yoda and Mace Windu. Then during the reconstruction of the new Jedi Order, Luke Skywalker is considered a \u201csenior member.\u201d</p><h4>Grand Master</h4><ul><li>Zym</li><li><a href=\"/yoda/4005-5396\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5396\">Yoda</a></li><li><a href=\"/luke-skywalker/4005-6315\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6315\">Luke Skywalker</a></li><li>Kenth Hammer</li></ul><h2>Major Story Arcs</h2><p>The term \u201cBBY\u201d means \u201cBefore Battle of Yavin\u201d and the term \u201cABY\u201d stands for \u201cAfter the Battle of Yavin.\u201d The Battle of Yavin is the battle that takes place in Star Wars IV: A New Hope.</p><h4>Ancient Jedi Order</h4><p>The Ancient Jedi Order is the earliest known Jedi Council, however there are other Jedi Councils previous to this council. The Ancient Jedi Order was shown in the video game \u201cStar Wars: Knights of the Old Republic.\u201d It was formed around 4,000 BBY during the Mandalorian Wars and the Jedi Civil War. The council members of this time was made up of Atris, <a href=\"/zez-kai-ell/4005-64260\" data-ref-id=\"4005-64260\">Zez-Kai Ell</a>, Lonna Vash, <a href=\"/vrook-lamar/4005-51437\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51437\">Vrook Lama</a>r, and Kavar.</p><h4>The Mandalorian War</h4><p>Prior to the Mandalorian War, the Mandalorians were defeated during the Sith War in 3,996 BBY. However, unable to accept the defeat, the Mandalorians began invading non Republic worlds for 20 years. Eventually the Mandalorians would decide to attack and invade Republic space in the year 3,964 BBY. The Republic begged the Jedi Council to enter the war and help them, however the Jedi declined. They stated that they believe a real threat, possibly the rise of the Sith again, has yet to surface and wanted to wait until they reveal themselves before the Jedi will enter the war. However, two Jedi Knights named <a href=\"/darth-revan/4005-46930\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46930\">Revan</a> (A military genius) and <a href=\"/darth-malak/4005-47892\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47892\">Malak</a> decided to defy the Jedi Council and enter the war themselves. Revan was very popular amongst the Jedi, and his actions to defy the Jedi Council to enter the war inspired other Jedi to follow him. One most notable Jedi Knight that joins Revan is known as \u201cThe Exile\u201d as his or her name is never revealed (The Exile is the playable character in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic II). Once some of the Jedi joined the Republic, the war truly began. Jedi followers of Revan automatically became Generals of the Republic Army and would lead them to battle against the Mandalorians.</p><p>The final battle of the war was at Malachor V. The Exile is the general of this Republic army and leads them on an assault against the Mandalorian space fleet. Unknown to most of the Republic soldiers during the battle at Malchor V was that an engineer named Bao-Dur created a weapon called the \u201cMass Shadow Generator.\u201d The Exile would give the command to Bao-Dur to activate the weapon and it ends up destroy everything and everyone, Mandalorians and Republic soldiers, on Malachor V.</p><p>After the war ended, the Exile would severe his connection to the force because of the horrors that he has done to Malachor V. The Exile is then met in front of the Jedi Council, where they officially exile him for \u201cfollowing Revan.\u201d However, the Jedi Council exiled him because he is a fallen Jedi who defied their teachings, and felt it could be a threat to the down fall of the Jedi. Meanwhile, Revan and Malak were celebrated as heroes to the Republic. Revan and Malak then took a Republic Fleet and claimed that they were going to go after the remaining Mandalorian fleets. However, they were actually searching for the \u201cStar Forge\u201d after learning secrets about it and the Jedi temples on Malachor V. One year later, Revan and Malak returned as the Dark Lord of the Sith. This begins the Jedi Civil War.</p><h4>Jedi Civil War</h4><p>Around 3,959 BBY, Revan and Malak returned as Sith Lords, and Revan took the mantle of the Dark Lord of the Sith since he was stronger then Malak. Revan and Malak declare war on the Republic, the Jedi, and all those who follow their ideals. During the Jedi Civil War, many Jedi would switch over to the Dark Side. This leads to the deaths and conversions of many Jedi. Revan became one of the most powerful Sith Lords of all time during this era, he and Malak would continue to conquer many Republic space in the galaxy. The Republic and Jedi knew how powerful Revan was, as they believed that it was through his sheer will and force that they were the victors of the Mandalorian War. The Republic knew that they cannot keep the Sith from winning the battle, so they decided to set a trap for Revan. The Republic sent a Jedi Padawan named <a href=\"/bastila-shan/4005-56320\" data-ref-id=\"4005-56320\">Bastila Shan</a> and a group of other Jedi Knights to board Revan\u2019s flagship.</p><p>The Republic believed that the only way to win is to use Bastila\u2019s \u201cBattle Meditation\u201d (a rare and powerful technique) on Revan. Revan is so powerful that he could easily kill Bastila and the other Jedi on the ship. However, Malak decides to turn on Revan in order to take the Dark Lord of the Sith mantle. Malak shoots at Revan\u2019s flagship in an attempt to kill the Jedi and Revan at the same time, however he would unknowingly be unsuccessful. Revan was still dying from that attack though, and the code of the Jedi forces Bastila to use the Force to save Revan\u2019s life. They end up forming a bond between each other. Revan would be brought back to the Jedi Council, who took the advantage of his damaged mind to reprogram it in order to keep his Dark Lord memories from Revan.</p><p>When Revan reawakens, he does not know anything about his past. Eventually he learns that he has the ability to use the force. After meeting with the Jedi Council, and as wary as they were of Revan\u2019s abilities, they allowed him to undergo the Jedi training. After he completes the Jedi training, Revan, Bastila, and their companions travel the galaxy in search of the Star Forge, which is said to be the key to ending the war. Eventually Bastila would be kidnapped by Malak, who was threatened by her \u201cBattle Meditation.\u201d He eventually forces Bastila to fall to the Dark Side and became Malak\u2019s new apprentice.</p><p>Revan would later confront a dark Bastila, who was tempting him into becoming one of the Sith again and retake his mantle of the Dark Lord of the Sith, revealing to Revan that he was once the Dark Lord. However, Revan would be able to reject the temptations and Bastila would flee to the Star Forge. On the Star Forge, Revan and his companions fought their way to Malak, but just before Malak, Revan had to battle Bastila. Revan would be able to convince Bastila to return to the light side due to the powerful bond the two had, that eventually became love. Revan then proceeded to confront Malak. Revan would engage against his former friend Malak in an epic battle. However, Malak was not strong enough to win and Revan ends up defeating Malak, and killing him with regret. One year after the fall of the Sith Empire, Revan decided to leave the Republic after he discovers an ancient Sith threat, he decides to go end it himself.</p><h4>The Thousand Year Peace</h4><p>In the year 1,000 BBY up to the <a href=\"/battle-of-yavin/4015-45961\" data-ref-id=\"4015-45961\">Battle of Yavin</a>, it was a time of peace for the Republic and the Jedi. The Jedi Order accepted new laws that were laid out and began enforcing them. Many great Jedi would be born during this period including Yoda, at the year 896 BBY, who is arguably the greatest Jedi Master of all time. Other notable Jedi born were <a href=\"/mace-windu/4005-5395\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5395\">Mace Windu</a> in the year 72 BBY, <a href=\"/count-dooku/4005-5392\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5392\">Count Dooku</a> in the year 102 BBY, <a href=\"/obi-wan-kenobi/4005-2206\" data-ref-id=\"4005-2206\">Obi Wan Kenobi</a> in the year 57 BBY, and <a href=\"/darth-vader/4005-6342\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6342\">Anakin Skywalker</a> in the year 41 BBY. The time of peace would lead to a time of war starting with some Mandalorian problems, then the Sith are beginning to rise again.</p><h4>The Old Jedi Order</h4><p>This Jedi Council consisted of 12 of the most powerful and most wise Jedi Masters. Yoda Mace Windu Obi Wan Kenobi Anakin <a href=\"/kit-fisto/4005-6330\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6330\">Kit Fisto</a> and <a href=\"/shaak-ti/4005-46940\" data-ref-id=\"4005-46940\">Shaak Ti</a> and more. They serve as the <a href=\"/emperor-palpatine/4005-16164\" data-ref-id=\"4005-16164\">Chancello</a>r's advisers of the Galactic Republic. This group of councils were made up of five lifetime members (two of them were senior members), four long-term members, and three limited-term members. This Jedi Order would fall during the Great Jedi Purge.</p><h4>The Rise of the Sith (Star Wars Prequel Trilogy)</h4><p>The presence of the Sith is once again noticed by the Jedi in the year 32 BBY. The first Sith to show his face was <a href=\"/darth-maul/4005-5406\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5406\">Darth Maul</a>, an apprentice of the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious. While protecting the <a href=\"/padme-amidala/4005-6343\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6343\">Princess Padame</a>, <a href=\"/qui-gon-jinn/4005-5411\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5411\">Qui-Gon Jinn</a> crosses path with Anakin Skywalker, who is said to have been born from the Force which means he is \u201cthe Chosen One.\u201d Qui-Gon Jinn would ask the council to allow Anakin to train and become a Jedi. After debating back and forth, the council members decided to allow Anakin to undergo the Jedi training.</p><p>Later, Obi-Wan Kenobi defeats Darth Maul, the Jedi\u2019s suspicion of another powerful Dark Lord in existence became true. Eventually, Obi-Wan Kenobi would decide to accept Anakin as his Padawan. Count Dooku would fall to the dark side after the death of Darth Maul and become Darth Sidous\u2019 new apprentice for the next 10 years.</p><h4>The Chosen One</h4><p>The chosen one is first mentioned in Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace. The \u201cChosen One\u201d is a prophecy Jedi believe that someday, someone will be born and bring balance to the Force. Qui-Gon Jinn believed that the \u201cChosen One\u201d will bring balance to the Force by destroying the Sith.</p><p>Many fans have been confused with what \u201cThe Chosen One\u201d is and what he was supposed to do to bring balance to the force. George Lucas has confirmed that Anakin Skywalker is the Chosen One. George Lucas also confirmed that in order to bring balance to the Force, the Chosen One must destroy the Sith. This is true since in the Empire Strikes Back, Anakin does destroy the Sith and redeem himself when he kills Darth Sidious and then he dies right afterwards, bringing balance to the Force.</p><h4>Clone Wars</h4><p>Count Dooku and Palpatine began creating a massive army of clones and chose to clone <a href=\"/jango-fett/4005-6344\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6344\">Jango Fett</a> after he agreed to it. The Clone Wars was started because Senator Palpatine (Darth Sidious) took advantage of the star systems that decided to separate themselves from the Republic, dubbing them the \u201cSeparatists.\u201d Palpatine plotted both the Separatists and the Republic against each other. Palpatine acted as the senator towards the Republic and acted as the Dark Lord of the Sith towards the Separatists. Eventually, as Senator Palpatine, he proposed to the senate for a Military Creation Act, it allows them to create a large army themselves. While most of the senators supported the act (except for Padme), it never came to a vote because of the discovery of the Confederacy of Independent Systems\u2019 (Separatists) army on Geonosis. This led to the Battle of <a href=\"/geonosis/4020-56447\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56447\">Geonosis</a>, where many Jedi Knights lost their lives. Due to this, Palpatine was given the emergency power of the Republic Senate. Palpatine was now able to approve of the mass production of a clone army by himself. The Clone army would then come to save the remaining Jedi and Republic soldiers.</p><p>Three years after the Battle of Geonosis (Star Wars II: Attack of the Clones) and during the Revenge of the Sith, Palpatine was kidnapped by the Separatists. Palpatine would eventually be rescued by Obi-Wan Kenoni and Anakin Skywalker. Duruing the Battle of Utapau, <a href=\"/general-grievous/4005-44582\" data-ref-id=\"4005-44582\">General Grievous</a> (leader of the Separatists) was killed by Obi-Wan Kenobi. The battles would spread across the entire galaxy. Eventually Anakin Skywalker would fall to the Dark Side after he discovers Mace Windu and Chancellor Palpatine battling. Palpatine had promised Anakin that the Dark Side of the Force would help him save Padme. After Anakin cuts off the hand of Windu, allowing Palpatine to kill him, Anakin completely fell to the Dark Side and was soon dubbed Darth Vader. Palpatine then convinced Darth Vader that the Jedi are the threat of the galaxy and are planning to overthrow the Republic. He then sends Vader over to the <a href=\"/jedi-temple/4020-56425\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56425\">Jedi Temple</a> to kill all the younglings. Vader\u2019s next mission was to kill the Separatists leaders, meanwhile Palpatine issued \u201c <a href=\"/order-66/4015-55868\" data-ref-id=\"4015-55868\">Order 66</a>.\u201d This alerted all clone troopers to kill their Jedi commanders, leading to the \u201cGreat Jedi Purge\u201d and the rise of the <a href=\"/empire/4060-45742\" data-ref-id=\"4060-45742\">Galactic Empire</a>.</p><h4>The Great Jedi Purge</h4><p>The Great Jedi Purge happened right before the end of the Clone Wars. It is the massacre of the entire Jedi Order by Darth Sidious. Sidious intended to kill all of the Jedi once and for all in order for him to become the Emperor of the galaxy. Prior to the Purge, Palpatine was just discovered as the Dark Lord of the Sith by Anakin, who in turn alerted Mace Windu about the Chancellor. During the battle between Mace Windu and Palpatine, Windu had Palpatine begging for his life until Anakin interrupts. Anakin had already been tempted by the Dark Side earlier by Palpatine, who told him that it was the only way to save Padme. Anakin would severe Windu\u2019s lightsaber hand and then Palpatine would use his Force Lightning and kill Windu. Anakin fully falls into the Dark Side and is renamed Darth Vader.</p><p>Darth Sidious then tells him that all of the Jedi must be destroyed. Vader had begun to suspect that the Jedi were plotting to kill members of the senate, and Palpatine would fully convince Vader that they are trying to overthrow the Republic. Vader is then told to go to the Jedi Temple with Clone Troopers to kill all the Jedi there. Palpatine then orders the clone troopers to initiate \u201cOrder 66,\u201d which is an order to all clone troopers to kill their commanding Jedi. With Order 66 in effect, Jedi from all over the galaxy would be killed. However, even though many Jedi died, not all the Jedi would be killed during this purge. Some would survive due to the clone becoming so accustomed to serving that Jedi.</p><p>Now that most of the Jedi have been killed, Darth Sidious was able to stand in front of the senate, and declared himself the new emperor and ordered that the Republic become the Empire. With Obi-Wan Kenobi and Yoda being the only known Jedi alive, they sought out to end the Sith before it fully strengthens. Obi-Wan would confront the Dark Lord\u2019s new apprentice, Darth Vader at <a href=\"/mustafar/4020-56941\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56941\">Mustafar</a>. While Yoda confronts Darth Sidious at the Galactic Senate. Yoda and Sidious would begin fighting, however Sidious would come out the victor. Yoda was forced to flee and go into exile while the Sith became more powerful. Meanwhile, Obi-Wan faces his former pupil in the fiery mountains of Mustafar. Kenobi would successfully defeat Vader and handicapped him at the same time. After Vader\u2019s body was repaired, Sidious gave Vader a mission to finish off the remaining surviving Jedi all across the Galaxy. Vader would accept the mission and travel from galaxy to galaxy to eliminate all the Jedi. Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi would be the only known surviving Jedi during the second trilogy.</p><h4>The Galactic Empire, no more Jedi?</h4><p>The Emperor knows that he has not destroyed all of the Jedi yet, so during this time he creates Jedi Hunters. The Jedi Hunters are to search and destroy all Jedi, including their friends and family or anyone connected to the Jedi. Meanwhile, the Emperor continued to train those he\u2019d come to call \u201cHands,\u201d his personal body guards that have the ability to use the Force. One most notable agent was <a href=\"/mara-jade/4005-20417\" data-ref-id=\"4005-20417\">Mara Jade</a>, she would eventually become a Jedi Knight along with Luke Skywalker. These were dark times for the people of the Galactic Empire. Eventually rebellions would spark up and fight against the Empire.</p><p>Luke Skywalker is the most notable of the members of the rebellion. After the destruction of the Death Star, Luke travels to <a href=\"/dagobah/4020-56380\" data-ref-id=\"4020-56380\">Dagobah</a> in search for a great Jedi named Yoda. Yoda would accept Luke as his pupil after Obi-Wan (in spirit form since he was killed by Darth Vader in \u201cA New Hope\u201d) convinces him. Luke would eventually succeed in training and become a Jedi himself, despite his age.</p><h4>The Return of the Jedi</h4><p>Luke Skywalker is now a full fledged Jedi Knight, and with the death of Obi-Wan Kenobi, and the recent death of Yoda, he is possibly the only Jedi Knight left in the entire galaxy. First, Luke would save his friends from <a href=\"/jabba-the-hutt/4005-5441\" data-ref-id=\"4005-5441\">Jabba the Hutt</a>, then they all reorganized and came up with a plan to take down the Empire. While on Endor, Luke decides to turn himself over the the Empire for two reasons: He does not want to give away the position of the Rebels, and also he was hoping to convince his father to rejoin to light side of the Force. However, Vader rejects the offer to rejoin the light side, and takes Luke to the Emperor. Luke would reject the temptations of join the Dark Side and be forced to battle his father once again.</p><p>Luke becomes enraged his Vader threatens to turn <a href=\"/princess-leia/4005-33545\" data-ref-id=\"4005-33545\">Leia</a> to the Dark Side, and Luke lashes out at Vader. However, after cutting off one of Vader\u2019s robotic arms, Luke regains control of himself after realizing that he may do the exact same thing his father did. Sidious would then take advantage of the moment and strike Luke with Force Lightning. Luke calls to his father for help, and seeing his son suffer, Vader could not sit there and watch. Vader then throws Sidious into the reactor core, killing him. Then Vader does not allow Luke to try and save his life, eventually dying in his son\u2019s arms. The Jedi prophecy is now complete, as the Sith have been completely destroyed.</p><h4>The New Jedi Order</h4><p>After the fall of Emperor Palpatine Luke Skywalker began to seek out others who were attuned to the force, in an effort to rebuild the Jedi Order. He found numerous candidates, His twin sister, Princess Leia, Rebel agent, <a href=\"/kyle-katarn/4005-48287\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48287\">Kyle Katarn</a>, Former Hand of Emperor Palpatine, Mara Jade, The Bounty Hunter, <a href=\"/zuckuss/4005-51356\" data-ref-id=\"4005-51356\">Zuckuss</a>, the Wookiee, Lobacca, and later the children of Han Solo and Leia, <a href=\"/anakin-solo/4005-6372\" data-ref-id=\"4005-6372\">Anakin Solo</a>, <a href=\"/jacen-solo/4005-47939\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47939\">Jacen Solo</a>, <a href=\"/jaina-solo/4005-47940\" data-ref-id=\"4005-47940\">Jaina Solo</a>, and later still he and Mara's son <a href=\"/ben-skywalker/4005-48044\" data-ref-id=\"4005-48044\">Ben Skywalker</a>, just to name a few.</p><p>Though some such as Zuckuss chose not to remain with the order, and despite catastrophic events such as the Yuuzhan Vong War, the new Jedi Order persevered through many hard and seemingly hopeless times, and managed to rebuild what was lost due to the Empire's Jedi Purge.</p>",

        "description": "<h2>History</h2><p>The crew of Serenity's history is explored in part in the television series <em>Firefly</em> (no longer running) and in the comics. In the first episode in the television series, <a href=\"/malcolm-reynolds/4005-41697\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41697\"> Mal</a> and his starter crew, <a href=\"/jayne-cobb/4005-42085\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42085\"> Jayne</a>, <a href=\"/kaylee/4005-42157\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42157\"> Kaylee</a>, <a href=\"/wash/4005-41802\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41802\"> Wash</a> and <a href=\"/zoe-washburne/4005-41801\" data-ref-id=\"4005-41801\"> Zoe</a> (later, the show runs an episode showing how the original team was brought together), need work since their last job essentially failed when Badger failed to accept the stolen goods. The suggestion was brought up that they take on passengers; some deemed it risky, but they decided to do so. Who they end up transporting happens to be <a href=\"/river-tam/4005-42084\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42084\"> River </a>and <a href=\"/simon-tam/4005-42086\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42086\"> Simon Tam</a>, along with <a href=\"/book/4005-42088\" data-ref-id=\"4005-42088\"> Shepherd Book</a> and an Alliance mole. River at the time was locked cryogenically in a storage compartment for safe and stealthy transport. Simon had to disguise himself and ended up acting suspicious, while the mole appeared to be perfectly normal. The mole soon discovers Simon's identity, and sends out a distress signal by hard-wiring the ship to broadcast the signal. Wash catches it in time, and Mal believes Simon to be the Alliance spy. He hunted him down, and punched him in the face, sending Simon reeling from shock and confusion. Simon told him that he had the wrong guy, and Mal turned to find the mole holding him at gunpoint. The mole made veiled comments alluding to the fact that Simon and River were fugitives, and when the mole was locked in one of the ship's spare rooms, Mal briefly interrogated Simon and decided to open up the doctor's mysterious crate, and discovered a sleeping River inside, who promptly awoke and started babbling incoherently and was comforted by Simon. The story was then related to the crew about how he and River were geniuses, she in practically every subject and he in a few less but brilliant nonetheless. Both being highly skilled, they wanted to be challenged. River found a school she wanted to enroll in, simply called The Academy. She sent a few letters home at first, then communication stopped. It resumed many months later with letters with gibberish, false stories and misspellings, 'from the girl who corrected [Simon's] spelling at the age of three.' Simon had left being a top doctor at the largest Alliance medical hospital when he realized his sister was in trouble. River was being experimented on and altered by the Alliance, conditioning her into a superhuman fighting machine with a secret purpose even she did not know for a long time. The letters were a code, telling him \"They're hurting us. Please help.\" He tried as hard as he could to find a way to rescue her, and finally enlisted the help of an underground resistance movement who freed her. Simon was on the run from the authorities, who wanted River back. Simon and River were later accepted into the family with Shepherd because Mal 'reasoned' that they needed a doctor, and that a preacher \"wouldn't be bad to have.\" Thus was born the Serenity team.</p><p> </p><h2>The Ballad of Serenity</h2><p> </p><p>This was the original theme song for the television series. It was written by Joss Whedon and performed by Sonny Rhodes.</p><p> </p><p>Take my love, Take my land,</p><p>Take me where I cannot stand.</p><p> </p><p>I don't care, I'm still free,</p><p>You can't take the sky from me.</p><p> </p><p>Take me out, to the black</p><p>Tell 'em I ain't coming back.</p><p> </p><p>Burn the land and boil the sea</p><p>You can't take the sky from me.</p><p> </p><p>There's no place I can be,</p><p>Since I found Serenity.</p><p>You can't take the sky from me...</p>",

The Ragna Rok (The Fatal Destiny) Project was one. During his meditations in <span>Italy</span>, <span>Grigori Rasputin</span> was approached by <span>Heinrich Himmler</span> to lead a group of Nazi occultists in building <span>weapons of mass destruction</span>. Eventually, after recognizing the potential in Haupstein, Kurtz, and Kroenen, Rasputin assembled them as part of his Ragna Rok project.</p> <p>Rasputin promised Hitler a \u201cmiracle\u201d which would turn the tide of the war. Secretly, Rasputin hoped to trigger an apocalyptic event that would begin a new <span>Eden</span>.</p> <p>On <span>December 23</span>, <span>1944</span>, on <span>Tarmagant Island</span>, (a small island off the <span>Scottish</span> coast) Project Ragna Rok entered into its final phase. Rasputin called forth the key to the <span>apocalypse</span> from <span>Hell</span>. Complications arose when the key did not appear on Tarmagant Island, but rather in a ruined church in <span>East Bromwich</span>, <span>England</span>. Even worse, the key, serving as the massive stone right hand of an infant demon, was recovered by the <span>Allies</span>. The demon would later become <span>Hellboy</span>, and his right hand would be much sought after. Von Krupt viewed the project as a failure, and the team officially disbanded. Rasputin headed to the Arctic Circle in pursuit of a long-lost temple to the <span>Ogdru Jahad</span>, while Haupstein, Kurtz, and Kroenen <span>cryogenically froze</span> themselves until Rasputin needed them once again.</p>",
